    """
    Normalize a Fourier spectrum.

    Apply normalizations defined in [1]_ to the DFT spectrum.
    Note that the phase is maintained in all cases, i.e., instead of taking
    the squared absolute values for ``'power'`` and ``'psd'``, the complex
    spectra are multiplied with their absolute values to ensure a correct
    renormalization.
    For detailed information and explanations, refer to
    :py:mod:`FFT concepts <pyfar._concepts.fft>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec : numpy array
        N dimensional array which has the frequency bins in the last
        dimension. E.g., ``spec.shape == (10,2,129)`` holds 10 times 2 spectra
        with 129 frequency bins each.
    n_samples : int
        number of samples of the corresponding time signal
    sampling_rate : number
        sampling rate of the corresponding time signal in Hz
    fft_norm : string, optional
        ``'none'``
            Do not apply any normalization. Appropriate for energy signals
            such as impulse responses.
        ``'unitary'``
            Multiply `spec` by factor of two as in [1]_ Eq. (8)
            (except for 0 Hz and the Nyquist frequency at half the sampling
            rate) to obtain the single-sided spectrum.
        ``'amplitude'``
            Scale spectrum by ``1/n_samples`` as in [1]_ Eq. (4)
            to obtain the amplitude spectrum.
        'rms'
            Scale spectrum by :math:`1/\\sqrt{2}` as in [1]_
            Eq.(10) to obtain the RMS spectrum.
        'power'
            Power spectrum, which equals the squared RMS spectrum
            (except for the retained phase).
        'psd'
            The power spectrum is scaled by ``n_samples/sampling_rate`` as in
            [1]_ Eq. (6)

        Note that the `unitary` normalization is also applied for `amplitude`,
        `rms`, `power`, and `psd` if the input spectrum is single sided (see
        `single_sided`).
    inverse : bool, optional
        apply the inverse normalization. The default is ``False``.
    single_sided : bool, optional
        denotes if `spec` is a single sided spectrum up to half the sampling
        rate or a both sided (full) spectrum. If ``single_sided=True`` the
        `unitary` normalization according to [1]_ Eq. (8) is applied unless
        ``fft_norm='none'``.
        The default is ``True``.
    window : None, array like
        window that was applied to the time signal before performing the FFT.
        Affects the normalization as in [1]_ Eqs. (11-13). The window must be
        an array-like with `n_samples` length and. The default is ``None``,
        which denotes that no window was applied.

    Returns
    -------
    spec : numpy array
        normalized input spectrum
