    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Signal, None

            The filter is normalized such that the phase response reaches its
            midpoint at angular (e.g. rad/s) frequency `Wn`. This happens for
            both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the
            "phase-matched" case.
            The magnitude response asymptotes are the same as a Butterworth
            filter of the same order with a cutoff of `Wn`.
            This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.
        ``'delay'``
            The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband
            is 1/`Wn` (e.g., seconds). This is the "natural" type obtained by
            solving Bessel polynomials.
        ``'mag'``
            The filter is normalized such that the gain magnitude is -3 dB at
            the angular frequency `Wn`.

        The default is 'phase'.
    sampling_rate : None, number
        The sampling rate in Hz. Only required if signal is None. The default

        This filter bank has -6 dB cut-off frequencies. For sufficient lengths

    The filters have a linear phase with a delay of ``n_samples/2`` and are

    1. The magnitude response is designed using squared sine/cosine ramps to

    2. The overlap between the filters is calculated between the center and
       upper cut-off frequencies and not between the center and lower cut-off
       frequencies. This enables smaller pass-bands with unity gain, which
       might be advantageous for applications that apply analysis and

        ``(63, 16000)``
    overlap : float
        Band overlap of the filter slopes between 0 and 1. Smaller values yield
        wider pass-bands and steeper filter slopes. The default is ``1``.
    slope : int, optional
        Number > 0 that defines the width and steepness of the filter slopes.
        Larger values yield wider pass-bands and steeper filter slopes. The
        default is ``0``.
    n_samples : int, optional
        Length of the filter in samples. Longer filters yield more exact
        filters. The default is ``2**12``.
