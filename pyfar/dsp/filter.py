    This is a wrapper for scipy.signal.bessel(). Which creates digitial

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Signal, None
        The Signal to be filterd. Pass None to create the filter without
        applying it.
    N : int
        The order of the Bessel/Thomson filter
    frequency : number, array like

        like containing the lower and upper cut-off frequencies in Hz if
        `btype` is bandpass or bandstop.
    btype : str
        One of the following 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'. The
        default is 'lowpass'.
    norm : str
        Critical frequency normalization:
        ``phase``
            The filter is normalized such that the phase response reaches its
            midpoint at angular (e.g. rad/s) frequency `Wn`. This happens for
            both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the
            "phase-matched" case.
            The magnitude response asymptotes are the same as a Butterworth
            filter of the same order with a cutoff of `Wn`.
            This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.
        ``delay``
            The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband
            is 1/`Wn` (e.g., seconds). This is the "natural" type obtained by
            solving Bessel polynomials.
        ``mag``
            The filter is normalized such that the gain magnitude is -3 dB at
            angular frequency `Wn`.

        The default is ``phase``.
    sampling_rate : None, number
        The sampling rate in Hz. Only required if signal is None. The default
        is None.

    Returns
    -------
    signal : Signal
