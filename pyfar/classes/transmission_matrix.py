The following introduces the :py:class:`~TransmissionMatrix` class available
in pyfar.

Transmission matrices (short T-matrices) are a convenient representation of
`Two-ports` or `Quadrupoles`. These can represent systems from various
fields, e.g. electrical circuits, mechanical vibration, (acoustic) transmission
lines.

System properties like input impedance or transfer functions can directly be
derived from a T-matrix. Furthermore, systems can be cascaded my multiplying
consecutive T-matrices simply using the ``@`` operator:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pyfar as pf
>>> frequencies = (100,200,300)
>>>
>>> # T-matrix with arbitrary data
>>> A = np.ones(len(frequencies))
>>> (B,C,D) = (A+1,A+2,A+3)
>>> tmat = pf.TransmissionMatrix.from_abcd(A,B,C,D,frequencies)
>>>
>>> # T-matrix of a bypass system
>>> tmat_bypass = pf.TransmissionMatrix.create_identity(frequencies)
>>>
>>> # Cascade
>>> tmat_out = tmat @ tmat_bypass
>>> tmat_out.freq == tmat.freq

class TransmissionMatrix(FrequencyData):
    r"""Class representing a transmission matrix.

    This implementation is based on a paper by Lampton [#]_ and uses the ABCD-
    representation. A single T-matrix is a (2x2)-matrix of the form:

    .. math::
        T = \begin{bmatrix}
                A & B \\
                C & D
            \end{bmatrix}

    This class is derived from :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData`,
    representing a frequency-dependent matrix of a multi-dimensional form
    In the easiest case, each matrix entry (A,B,C,D) is a single-channel
    FrequencyData object (i.e. a vector depending on frequency). However,
    additional dimensions can be used to represent additional variables (e.g.
    multiple layouts of an electrical circuit).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is derived from
    :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData` but has a special
    constraint: The underlying frequency domain data must match a shape like
    (..., 2, 2, N). The last axis refers to the frequency, and the two axes
    before to the ABCD-Matrix (which is a 2x2 matrix), so the resulting cshape
    is (...,2,2).

    Another point is the numerical handling when deriving input/output
    impedance or transfer functions (see :py:func:`~input_impedance`,
    :py:func:`~output_impedance`, :py:func:`~transfer_function`):
    In the respective equations, the load impedance Zl is usually multiplied.
    However, Zl is applied in the form of 1/Zl (as admittance) for Zl = inf
    to avoid numerical problems.
    There are additional cases where certain entries of the
    T-matrix being zero might still lead to the main denominator becoming zero.
    For these cases, the denominator is set to eps.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array_like, double
            Raw data in the frequency domain.
            In contrast to the :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData`
            class, data must have a shape of the form (..., 2, 2, N), e.g.
            (2, 2, 1024) or (3, 2, 2, 1024). In those examples 1024 refers to
            the number of frequency bins and the two dimensions before that to
            the (2x2) ABCD matrices. Supported data types are ``int``,
            ``float`` or ``complex``, where ``int`` is converted to ``float``.
        frequencies : array_like, double
            Frequencies of the data in Hz. The number of frequencies must match
            the size of the last dimension of data.
        comment : str, optional
            A comment related to the data. The default is ``""``, which
            initializes an empty string.

        Examples
        --------
