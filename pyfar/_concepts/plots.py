Plot contains many :py:mod:`plot functions <pyfar.plot>` that can be used to
visualize pyfar :py:mod:`audio objects <pyfar._concepts.audio_classes>` in the
time and frequency domain for inspecting data and generating scientific plots.

The plots are based on :doc:`Matplotlib<matplotlib:index>` and
all plot functions return Matplotlib axis objects for a flexible customization
of plots. In addition most plot functions pass keyword arguments (`kwargs`) to
Matplotlib.

This is an example for customizing the line color using a keyword argument and
the axis limits using the Matplotlib axis object:

.. plot::

    >>> import pyfar as pf
    >>> noise = pf.signals.noise(2**14)
    >>> ax = pf.plot.freq(noise, color=(.3, .3, .3))
    >>> ax.set_ylim(-60, -20)


Plot styles
-----------

Pyfar contains a `light` and `dark` plot style and applies the `light` plot
style by default in its :py:mod:`plot functions <pyfar.plot>`. If you want to
apply the style to code outside these functions you can use

::

    pyfar.plot.use()

to overwrite the currently used plot style or

::

    with pyfar.plot.context():
        # everything inside the with statement
        # uses the pyfar plot style

If you do not want to use the pyfar plot style, you can pass an empty
dictionary to the plot functions

::

    pyfar.plot.time(signal, style={})

This can also be used to overwrite specific parameters of the pyfar plot styles

::

    pyfar.plot.time(signal, style={axes.facecolor='black'})


Interactive plots
-----------------

It is often helpful to quickly navigate through the channels of multi-channel
data or zoom into the plot around a specific frequency or amplitude. This can
be done with the pyfar :py:func:`keyboard shortcuts <pyfar.plot.shortcuts>` and
requires an interactive :ref:`backend<matplotlib:what-is-a-backend>`
like *QtAgg*.
