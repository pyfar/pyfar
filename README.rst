The python package for acoustics research (pyfar) offers classes to store
audio data, filters, coordinates, and orientations. It also contains common
functions for digital audio signal processing.

Getting Started
===============

Check out the `examples notebook`_ for a tour of the most important pyfar
functionality and `read the docs`_ for the complete documentation. Packages
related to pyfar are listed at `pyfar.org`_.

Installation
============

Use pip to install pyfar

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyfar

(Requires Python 3.8 or higher)

Audio file reading/writing is supported through `SoundFile`_, which is based on `libsndfile`_. On Windows and OS X, it will be installed automatically. On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager, for example ``sudo apt-get install libsndfile1``.
