    "## Arithmetic Operations with Audio Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms require arithmetic operations on signals, such as adding or multiplying two signals, or performing a matrix multiplication between an array and a multi-channel signal. To this end, pyfar implements the operations `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `power`, and `matrix_multiplications` in top level functions. The following examples illustrates how to perform arithmetic operations using these functions and the standard Python operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, and `@`. It is best to learn about `pyfar audio objects` before starting continuing with these examples."
