[Ahrens, et al. 2020](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=20838)). Two additional normalizations are available. `'unitary'` only applies the weighting for the single sided spectrum (Eq. 8 in Ahrens et al. 2020). `'none'` applies no normalization, which is usefull for signals with finite energy such as impulse responses. The default normalization is `'none'`. Let's create a signal with a different normalization"
