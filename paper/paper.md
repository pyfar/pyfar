# Summary

`Pyfar` is a Python package and ecosystem for researchers in acoustics and audio signal processing.
It provides well documented and tested implementations of common operations and algorithms.
At it's core, `pyfar` provides encapsulated audio, filter, and coordinate objects to facilitate convenient
handling of data and related meta-data.
Relevant operators are implemented for the respective classes to enable intuitive and readable code.
On top of that `pyfar` provides functionality for

- audio and measurement signal generation,
- signal and data processing,
- visualization,
- file I/O.
